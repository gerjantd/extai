Q1:
Why do lemurs exhibit lower visual acuity compared to anthropoid primates, and how is their eye structure related to this difference?

A1:
Lemurs exhibit lower visual acuity compared to anthropoid primates primarily because they lack a well-developed fovea on their retinas. In anthropoid primates, a postorbital septum stabilizes the eye, allowing for the development of a fovea that provides higher visual acuity. Lemurs, however, possess only a postorbital bar, which does not offer the same stability, preventing the evolution of a fovea. As a result, regardless of whether they are nocturnal, cathemeral, or diurnal, lemurs have lower visual acuity and higher retinal summation compared to anthropoids.

Q2:
How do the visual fields of lemurs compare to those of anthropoid primates, and what anatomical feature accounts for this difference?

A2:
Lemurs have a wider combined visual field than anthropoid primates, with a range of 250–280° compared to the anthropoids' 180–190°. This difference is due to the slight angle between the eyes in lemurs, measured at 10–15°, whereas anthropoid primates have an angle of 0°, resulting in a narrower combined field. Although lemurs have lower visual acuity, their eye placement grants them a broader field of view, which can be advantageous in detecting peripheral movements.

Q3:
In what ways do the retinal structures of diurnal and nocturnal lemurs differ, particularly regarding rod and cone cell distribution?

A3:
Diurnal and nocturnal lemurs show significant differences in their retinal structures based on the distribution of rod and cone cells. Diurnal lemurs, although lacking a true fovea, have a cone-rich area centralis with a relatively high rod-to-cone ratio. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur’s retina has one cone for every five rods. In contrast, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, have retinas composed entirely of rod cells, optimizing their vision for low-light conditions. This distinction reflects the different visual needs based on their activity patterns, with nocturnal species relying solely on rods for better night vision.
