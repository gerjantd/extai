        Lemurs (and strepsirrhines in general) are considered to be less visually oriented than the higher primates, since they rely so heavily on their sense of smell and pheromone detection. The fovea on the retina, which yields higher visual acuity, is not well-developed. The postorbital septum (or bony closure behind the eye) in haplorrhine primates is thought to stabilize the eye slightly, allowing for the evolution of the fovea. With only a postorbital bar, lemurs have been unable to develop a fovea. Therefore, regardless of their activity pattern (nocturnal, cathemeral, or diurnal), lemurs exhibit low visual acuity and high retinal summation. Lemurs can see a wider visual field, however, than anthropoid primates due to a slight difference in the angle between the eyes, as shown in the following table:
      |                     | Angle between eyes    | Binocular field    | Combined field(binocular + periphery)    |
      |---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
      | Lemurs              | 10–15°                | 114–130°           | 250–280°                                 |
      | Anthropoid primates | 0°                    | 140–160°           | 180–190°                                 |
        Although they lack a fovea, some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, although less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis has a high rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) have only a few large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.

      - question: |
           Concerning angles between eyes, how much more is the angle between the eyes of lemurs in comparison to anthropoid primates?
        answer: |
           The angle between the eyes of lemurs is 10-15°, while anthropoid primates have an angle of 0°. This means that lemurs have a greater angle between their eyes compared to anthropoid primates.

          How lemurs are considered to be less visually oriented than the higher primates?
        answer: |
          Lemurs are considered to be less visually oriented than higher primates because they rely more on their sense of smell and pheromone detection. 
      - question: |
          How many rods can the eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain? 
        answer: |
          The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods.
  - context: |
      Lemurs are primates belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral (or plesiomorphic) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes (simians). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on Madagascar.[14] All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as adapiforms during the Eocene (56 to 34 mya) or Paleocene (66 to 56 mya).[2][14][15] Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a toothcomb, which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess.[16][17][18] A more recent hypothesis is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) primates. This is supported by comparative studies of the cytochrome b gene and the presence of the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups.[18][19] Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs, the adapiforms may have given rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be supported by molecular phylogenetic studies.[18] The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65 mya according to molecular studies,[20] although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55 mya for this divergence.However, the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene. Once part of the supercontinent Gondwana, the island of Madagascar has been isolated since it broke away from eastern Africa (~160 mya), Antarctica (~80–130 mya), and India (~80–90 mya).[21][22] Since ancestral lemurs are thought to have originated in Africa around 62 to 65 mya, they must have crossed the Mozambique Channel, a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560 km (350 mi).[18] In 1915, paleontologist William Diller Matthew noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar (including lemurs) can only be accounted for by random rafting events, where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers.[23] This form of biological dispersal can occur randomly over millions of years.[18][24] In the 1940s, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson coined the term "sweepstakes hypothesis" for such random events.[25] Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar,[26][27] but until recently, this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong ocean currents flow away from the island.[28] In January 2010, a report demonstrated that around 60 mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1,650 km (1,030 mi) south of their present-day positions, placing them in a different ocean gyre, producing currents that ran counter to what they are today. The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today, which would have pushed a raft along faster, shortening the trip to 30 days or less—short enough for a small mammal to survive easily. As the continental plates drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20 mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed, effectively isolating the lemurs and the rest of the terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa.[28] Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors, the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving arboreal mammalian groups, such as squirrels.[29] They were also spared from having to compete with monkeys, which evolved later. The intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness of monkeys gave them an advantage over other primates in exploiting the environment.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How did lemurs likely arrive on Madagascar, and what evidence supports this explanation?
        answer: |
          Lemurs are believed to have arrived on Madagascar by rafting across the Mozambique Channel from mainland Africa. This explanation, known as the "sweepstakes hypothesis," suggests that small groups of ancestral lemurs floated on mats of vegetation flushed out from African rivers. The idea is supported by the island's long isolation and the improbability of other migration routes. Additionally, a 2010 study showed that around 60 million years ago, ocean currents were different and would have carried rafts from Africa to Madagascar more swiftly—potentially in 30 days or less—making survival during the journey feasible for small mammals like early lemurs.
      - question: |
          Explain why lemurs evolved independently from monkeys and apes, despite sharing some ancestral traits with early primates.
        answer: |
          Lemurs evolved independently from monkeys and apes because they became isolated on Madagascar after their ancestors arrived there from Africa. Although they share some ancestral traits with early primates, lemurs are strepsirrhine primates, whereas monkeys and apes (simians) evolved separately. This isolation allowed lemurs to follow their own evolutionary path without direct competition from other primates like monkeys, whose intelligence and adaptability would have otherwise dominated the ecological niches lemurs occupied.
      - question: |
          What role did Madagascar's geological history play in the evolution and isolation of lemurs?
        answer: |
          Madagascar’s geological history played a crucial role in the evolution and isolation of lemurs. The island broke away from eastern Africa approximately 160 million years ago and remained isolated. Since ancestral lemurs arrived around 62 to 65 million years ago, well after the split, they evolved without competition from other mammals that later diversified on mainland Africa. This isolation meant lemurs did not have to compete with mammals such as squirrels or with simian primates, which evolved greater cognitive abilities and competitiveness, allowing lemurs to diversify and occupy a wide range of ecological niches on the island.
  - context: |
      Lemurs vary greatly in size. They include the smallest primates in the world and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently range in size from about 30 g (1.1 oz) for Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae) up to 7–9 kg (15–20 lb) for the indri (Indri indri) and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema).[61][62] One recently extinct species rivaled the gorilla in size, at 160–200 kg (350–440 lb) for Archaeoindris fontoynonti.[7][31]
      Close-up of a ruffed lemur's foot, showing the toilet-claw on the second toe and nails on all other toes
      Like all primates, lemurs have five divergent digits with nails (in most cases) on their hands and feet. Most lemurs possess a laterally compressed, elongated nail, called a toilet-claw, on the second toe and use it for scratching and grooming.[51][63] In addition to the toilet-claw, lemurs share a variety of other traits with other strepsirrhine primates, which include a rhinarium (or "wet nose"); a fully functional vomeronasal organ, which detects pheromones; a postorbital bar and the lack of postorbital closure (a wall of thin bone behind the eye); orbits (bony sockets that enclose the eye) that are not fully facing forward; left and right mandible (lower jaw) bones that are not fully fused; and a small brain-to-body mass ratio.
      Additional traits shared with other prosimian primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation.[16][64] Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less independent of the other fingers,[63] their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects.[22] On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs.[51] A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates.[63] Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, but not with the visually oriented higher primates.[22] This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question:
          What is the range of sizes among living lemur species, and which species represent the extremes?
        answer: |
            Living lemur species vary greatly in size, ranging from as small as about 30 grams (1.1 ounces) for Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae) to as large as 7–9 kilograms (15–20 pounds) for the indri (Indri indri) and the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema). This wide range demonstrates the remarkable diversity in body size within the lemur clade.
      - question: |
          What are some key anatomical traits that lemurs share with other strepsirrhine primates, and what functional purposes do they serve?
        answer: |
          Lemurs share several anatomical traits with other strepsirrhine primates, including a rhinarium (wet nose) and a fully functional vomeronasal organ, both of which support their strong reliance on the sense of smell for activities like territory marking and mate selection. They also have a postorbital bar but lack full postorbital closure, orbits that do not fully face forward, unfused mandible bones, and a relatively small brain-to-body mass ratio. These features are generally associated with a less visually oriented, more olfactory-driven way of interacting with their environment compared to higher primates.
      - question: |
          Why is it incorrect to describe lemurs as having prehensile tails, and what adaptations do they have instead for grasping?
        answer: |
          It is incorrect to describe lemurs as having prehensile tails because this trait is only found among certain New World monkeys, particularly the atelids. Instead of a prehensile tail, lemurs have other adaptations for grasping, such as a widely abducted hallux (first toe) that helps them grasp tree limbs effectively. Their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, meaning they are less capable of independent movement compared to fully opposable thumbs, which limits their precision in grasping and manipulating objects.
  - context: |
      Lemurs have low basal metabolic rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy during the dry season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass.The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly has one of the lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located at the base of the tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why do dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs accumulate fat before the dry season, and what happens to their body mass by the end of this period?
        answer: |
          Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs accumulate fat before the dry season by storing it in white adipose tissue located at the base of their tails and hind legs. This fat reserve allows them to enter a state of dormancy and rely on stored energy when food becomes scarce. As a result, their body mass can double before the dry season begins. By the end of the dry season, after prolonged periods of limited food availability and reliance on fat reserves, their body mass may decrease to half of what it was prior to dormancy, reflecting their adaptation to survive seasonal hardships.
      - question: |
          How do lemurs adapt their metabolism during the dry season, and why is this important for their survival?
        answer: |
          During the dry season, when food and water are scarce, lemurs adapt by lowering their basal metabolic rate (BMR) to conserve energy. They can reduce their metabolic rate to about 20% below the expected values for mammals of similar body mass. This metabolic adjustment is critical for survival because it minimizes the need for resources during a period when they are difficult to obtain, allowing lemurs to endure harsh environmental conditions with minimal energy expenditure.
      - question: |
          What behavioral strategies do lemurs use to complement their low basal metabolic rate, and how do these behaviors help conserve energy?
        answer: |
          To complement their low basal metabolic rate, lemurs engage in behaviors such as sunning themselves, sitting in a hunched posture, huddling in groups, and sharing nests. These activities help conserve energy by reducing heat loss. For example, huddling and nest sharing allow multiple individuals to retain warmth more effectively, minimizing the energy needed for thermoregulation. Sunning behaviors further help by absorbing solar heat, thereby decreasing the need to generate body heat metabolically.

      Lemur diets are highly variable and demonstrate a high degree of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary[38][58] and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.
      A common assumption in mammalogy is that small mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material and must have a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, it was thought that the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (insectivory). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.
      Plant material makes up the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are woody plants, including trees, shrubs, or lianas. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the bamboo lemurs (genus Hapalemur), and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) are known to consume herbs. While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible reason for this is that ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds—common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of tannins in their fronds. Likewise, mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content. Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids. The golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus), for instance, eats giant bamboo (Cathariostachys madagascariensis), which contains high levels of cyanide. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown. At the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating poison ivy (Taxicodendron radicans), yet have shown no ill effects.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What general dietary trend is observed among lemurs based on their size, and how does this reflect their feeding behavior?
        answer: |
          In general, the diet of lemurs varies according to their size: smaller lemur species primarily consume fruit and insects, making them omnivorous, while larger lemur species tend to be more herbivorous, feeding mostly on plant material. This trend reflects an adaptation to available resources and nutritional needs, where smaller lemurs, with higher metabolic demands, supplement their diet with protein from insects, while larger lemurs rely on abundant plant matter to meet their energy needs.
      - question: |
          How do lemurs' interactions with plant defenses like tannins and cyanide demonstrate their dietary adaptations?
        answer: |
          Lemurs exhibit remarkable dietary adaptations to overcome plant defenses such as tannins and cyanide. For instance, while most plants with high tannin content, like ferns and mangroves, are generally avoided, some lemurs have evolved mechanisms to tolerate or counteract these chemicals. A striking example is the golden bamboo lemur, which can consume giant bamboo containing cyanide at levels twelve times higher than what would be lethal for most mammals, though the exact physiological mechanisms remain unknown. These adaptations highlight lemurs' evolutionary responses to their challenging food environment in Madagascar.
      - question: |
          Why was the assumption that small primates must have insect-based diets challenged by observations of mouse lemurs?
        answer: |
          The assumption that small primates must rely on a high-protein insect-based diet was challenged by observations of mouse lemurs, which are the smallest living primates. Contrary to earlier beliefs, research showed that mouse lemurs consume more fruit than insects, demonstrating that even very small primates can sustain themselves largely on plant material. This finding reshaped understandings of primate dietary ecology, showing that small body size does not necessarily dictate a diet focused on animal protein.
