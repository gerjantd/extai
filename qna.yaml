  - context:|
Lemurs (and strepsirrhines in general) are considered to be less visually oriented than the higher primates, since they rely so heavily on their sense of smell and pheromone detection. The fovea on the retina, which yields higher visual acuity, is not well-developed. The postorbital septum (or bony closure behind the eye) in haplorrhine primates is thought to stabilize the eye slightly, allowing for the evolution of the fovea. With only a postorbital bar, lemurs have been unable to develop a fovea. Therefore, regardless of their activity pattern (nocturnal, cathemeral, or diurnal), lemurs exhibit low visual acuity and high retinal summation. Lemurs can see a wider visual field, however, than anthropoid primates due to a slight difference in the angle between the eyes, as shown in the following table:

|                     | Angle between eyes    | Binocular field    | Combined field(binocular + periphery)    |
|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Lemurs              | 10–15°                | 114–130°           | 250–280°                                 |
| Anthropoid primates | 0°                    | 140–160°           | 180–190°                                 |

Although they lack a fovea, some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, although less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis has a high rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) have only a few large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.
questions_and_answers: 
  - question: |
  Concerning angles between eyes, how much more is the angle between the eyes of lemurs in comparison to anthropoid primates?
    answer: |
The angle between the eyes of lemurs is 10-15°, while anthropoid primates have an angle of 0°. This means that lemurs have a greater angle between their eyes compared to anthropoid primates.
  - question: |
 How lemurs are considered to be less visually oriented than the higher primates?
    answer: |
Lemurs are considered to be less visually oriented than higher primates because they rely more on their sense of smell and pheromone detection. 
  - question: |
 How many rods can the eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain? 
    answer: |
The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods.
  - context:|
Lemurs are primates belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral (or plesiomorphic) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes (simians). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on Madagascar.[14] All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as adapiforms during the Eocene (56 to 34 mya) or Paleocene (66 to 56 mya).[2][14][15] Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a toothcomb, which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess.[16][17][18] A more recent hypothesis is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) primates. This is supported by comparative studies of the cytochrome b gene and the presence of the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups.[18][19] Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs, the adapiforms may have given rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be supported by molecular phylogenetic studies.[18] The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65 mya according to molecular studies,[20] although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55 mya for this divergence.[1] However, the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene.[2]

Once part of the supercontinent Gondwana, the island of Madagascar has been isolated since it broke away from eastern Africa (~160 mya), Antarctica (~80–130 mya), and India (~80–90 mya).[21][22] Since ancestral lemurs are thought to have originated in Africa around 62 to 65 mya, they must have crossed the Mozambique Channel, a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560 km (350 mi).[18] In 1915, paleontologist William Diller Matthew noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar (including lemurs) can only be accounted for by random rafting events, where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers.[23] This form of biological dispersal can occur randomly over millions of years.[18][24] In the 1940s, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson coined the term "sweepstakes hypothesis" for such random events.[25] Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar,[26][27] but until recently, this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong ocean currents flow away from the island.[28] In January 2010, a report demonstrated that around 60 mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1,650 km (1,030 mi) south of their present-day positions, placing them in a different ocean gyre, producing currents that ran counter to what they are today. The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today, which would have pushed a raft along faster, shortening the trip to 30 days or less—short enough for a small mammal to survive easily. As the continental plates drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20 mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed, effectively isolating the lemurs and the rest of the terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa.[28] Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors, the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving arboreal mammalian groups, such as squirrels.[29] They were also spared from having to compete with monkeys, which evolved later. The intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness of monkeys gave them an advantage over other primates in exploiting the environment.[7][17]
  - question: |
How did lemurs likely arrive on Madagascar, and what evidence supports this explanation?
    answer: |
Lemurs are believed to have arrived on Madagascar by rafting across the Mozambique Channel from mainland Africa. This explanation, known as the "sweepstakes hypothesis," suggests that small groups of ancestral lemurs floated on mats of vegetation flushed out from African rivers. The idea is supported by the island's long isolation and the improbability of other migration routes. Additionally, a 2010 study showed that around 60 million years ago, ocean currents were different and would have carried rafts from Africa to Madagascar more swiftly—potentially in 30 days or less—making survival during the journey feasible for small mammals like early lemurs.
  - question: |
Explain why lemurs evolved independently from monkeys and apes, despite sharing some ancestral traits with early primates.
    answer: |
Lemurs evolved independently from monkeys and apes because they became isolated on Madagascar after their ancestors arrived there from Africa. Although they share some ancestral traits with early primates, lemurs are strepsirrhine primates, whereas monkeys and apes (simians) evolved separately. This isolation allowed lemurs to follow their own evolutionary path without direct competition from other primates like monkeys, whose intelligence and adaptability would have otherwise dominated the ecological niches lemurs occupied.
  - question: |
What role did Madagascar's geological history play in the evolution and isolation of lemurs?
    answer: |
Madagascar’s geological history played a crucial role in the evolution and isolation of lemurs. The island broke away from eastern Africa approximately 160 million years ago and remained isolated. Since ancestral lemurs arrived around 62 to 65 million years ago, well after the split, they evolved without competition from other mammals that later diversified on mainland Africa. This isolation meant lemurs did not have to compete with mammals such as squirrels or with simian primates, which evolved greater cognitive abilities and competitiveness, allowing lemurs to diversify and occupy a wide range of ecological niches on the island.
